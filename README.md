Safe Cycling Map
================

A map showing how safe a street is for cycling, based on (arbitrary) metrics. See the
[key](https://github.com/jakecoppinger/safe-cycling-map/blob/main/docs/key.md) for how street safety is calculated.

I have added some tag selectors to capture the detailed tagging of bike lanes in Melbourne. All the other work has been done by [Jake Coppinger](https://github.com/jakecoppinger)

This data is not guaranteed to be accurate.

When zoomed in close, individual road and bicycle lanes are shown. When zoomed out, streets are
coloured by their safety ratings.

# Disclaimer
Warning: This is an arbitrary rating system. Data is open source and not guaranteed to be accurate.

This map uses OpenStreetMap data. It is not a complete or accurate map of the world and should not
be used in such a manner that deficiencies, omissions, inaccuracies or errors could result in death,
loss or injury. The maps are an iterative ongoing work-in-progress and everyone is welcome to
contribute editing the OpenStreetMap data if you spot inaccuracies. (warning courtesy of [CyclOSM](https://www.cyclosm.org/))

A map of bike infrastructure using [osm2streets](https://github.com/a-b-street/osm2streets) output.

Uses [osm2streets-vector-tileserver](https://github.com/jakecoppinger/osm2streets-vector-tileserver),
a vector tileserver I wrote to generate Protobuf GeoJSON vector tiles using the JS bindings to
osm2streets (which is written in Rust).


# Local development

See instructions for setting up the backend tileserve at 
[https://github.com/jakecoppinger/osm2streets-vector-tileserver](https://github.com/jakecoppinger/osm2streets-vector-tileserver)

Install packages:
`nvm install`
`npm i --legacy-peer-deps`

Run dev server:
`npm run start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
